      Because our Service focuses on lead generation, it is generally impossible
      to access, edit, or remove information once you have provided it to us.
      This is because we pass it to third parties, such as employers and hiring
      agencies, and we have no contractual right to demand that they provide you

      such passed on information. You agree that any information, once submitted

      your information with any third party and including, without limiting the

      others, whether or not it is done in exchange for consideration (in other
      words, we may disseminate it without requiring the third party pay us for
      it), or to any third party that acquires all or a part of our assets or
      the ownership of our company, or a successor in title to our business.

      in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable by third

    </p>
    <h2>Third Party Access to Your Information</h2>

      Although you are entering into an Agreement with roadrunners to disclose
      your information to us, we do use third party individuals and
      organizations to assist us, including contractors, web hosts, and others.
      Throughout the course of our provision of our Services to you, we may
      delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your
      information. For example, our web host stores the information that you
      provide us, and we may hire third parties to assist us in maintaining,
      repairing, improving, or otherwise assisting us with our Site and
      Services. It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we
      may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us
      under this Privacy Policy. For this reason, you hereby agree that for
      every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also
      grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain
      the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or
      otherwise improving or preserving our website or its underlying files or
      systems. You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these
      third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for
      their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly
      should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.
    </p>
    <h2>Law Enforcement/Subpoenas/Other Release of Information</h2>
    <p>
      You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we
      believe, in good faith, that it is necessary or required to do so for the
      purposes of legal or regulatory requirements, including in a civil action,
      criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we
      receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to
      give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may
      attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. We
      may provide the information required by the subpoena without any notice to
      you. We may also provide your information to third parties, if we deem the
      provision necessary in our sole discretion, to the protection of our
      rights or the rights, safety or property of our Site, our Service, other
      Users, or other third parties. We may also proactively report you and
      release your information without receiving any request to third parties
      where we believe that it is proper to do so for legal reasons, such as
      instances where we believe your actions violate any law of the United
      States or any other country having jurisdiction over us, our Site,
      Services, our Terms of Service, or this Privacy Policy. You release us
      from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your
      information in response to a request from law enforcement agencies,
      governmental agencies, courts, private litigants., or otherwise in
      accordance with this paragraph. We may release your information under the
      conditions listed in this paragraph whether it is to individuals or
      entities in the State of Pennsylvania, the rest of the United States, or

      covered under this Privacy Policy. However, you may unsubscribe from
      certain communications by notifying AllTruckJobs that you no longer wish
      to receive solicitations or information and we will remove you from our

      legislation applicable in the State of Pennsylvania and the United States.
